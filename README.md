# credit_card_optimizer
This is still a work in progress app to easily build an optimized credit card portfolio.
In its current version it too heavily accounts for rebatesa and does not do well at offering free cards.
The lazy fix right now is to have it just have a button that turns all rebates to zero, working on the same for just sign up bonuses.
The credit card list is from https://github.com/andenacitelli/credit-card-bonuses-api just doing a basic converted to match my formatting.
